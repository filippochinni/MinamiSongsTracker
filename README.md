# MinamiSongsTracker

**Minami Songs Tracker is a fanmade web-application to keep track of the songs of the great Japanese singer Minami.** <br><br>

The data for each song on this website is derived from an Excel spreadsheet which I personally made to create this Tracker, maybe in the future I will upload it.<br>

If you are a Minami fan, you already know that most of her older songs are basically unfindable; also those songs have no relation to Albums and have no year of release, so the data for those songs is incomplete.<br><br> 

The main Use Case of the application is to label each song as:
- **Unheard**: you have never listened to this song or you still don't have a clear idea of it.
- **Heard**: you have listened to this song but you did not add it to a Playlist.
- **Playlist**: you have this song in one of your personal Playlists.



The application allow to search for a Song by 3 different Search Criteria:
- **Song Name**: Search song by its title
- **Album/Single**: Search song by its Album or Album-Single
- **Year**: Search song by its release year (some songs have been released more than once)

It is also possbile to sort the Search results by 3 different Sort Criteria, which are the same as the Search Criteria. Click 2 times to make the order anti-alphabetic.<br><br>

**Important**:<br>
_I am a Computer Science Student, and a novice Web Developer, so this website is not a high level piece of software.<br>
The view on the Desktop version is better; it is fine on the Mobile version, but you may want to hold the device horizontally for better view.<br>
In order not to overcomplicate my job, to save the Labels changes made by each user I used the LocalStorage, so your Data will be lost if you clean recent browser history, delete cookies or delete (or change) the browser. Data might also delete if the Browser memory gets full, so i would suggest to visit the website and make some changes every once in a while (once every 2-5 months should be fine i think) as it "resets" the priority of the Data and they will become less likely to get deleted if the Browser memory gets full_.
